# Lambda Extras

Swifty helpers for working with AWS Lambda.

## üì± Requirements

Swift 5.7 toolchain with Swift Package Manager.

## üñ• Installation

Lambda Extras is distributed using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager). To install it into a project, add it as a dependency within your `Package.swift` manifest:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Mobelux/swift-lambda-extras.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Then, add the relevant product to any targets that need access to the library:

```swift
.product(name: "<product>", package: "swift-lambda-extras"),
```

Where `<product>` is one of the following:

- `LambdaExtrasCore`
- `LambdaExtras`
- `LambdaMocks`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

This package is intended to support the creation of lambdas composed of 2 parts:

- a generic target with a handler implementing the core logic without AWS dependencies
- an executable target using that generic one

### Handler

Create a target without AWS dependencies like `AWSLambdaRuntime` or  `AWSLambdaEvents` to implement the the lambda's core logic. Add a type to represent all environment variables that will be used in the lambda:

```swift
public enum Environment: String {
    case multiplier = "MULTIPLIER"
    ...
}
```

as well as a model for the handler's input and optionally its output:

```swift
public struct Multiplicand: Codable {
    public let value: Int

    public init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }
}
```

and a handler to implement the core logic of the lambda:

```swift
public struct MultiplyHandler {
    public init<C>(
        context: C
    ) async throws where C: InitializationContext, C: EnvironmentValueProvider<Environment> {
        // create any dependencies

        context.handleShutdown { eventLoop in
            // shut dependencies down ...
        }
    }

    public func handle<C>(
        _ event: Multiplicand,
        context: C
    ) async throws -> Int where C: RuntimeContext, C: EnvironmentValueProvider<Environment> {
        let multiplier = try context.value(for: .multiplier)
        return event.value * multiplier
    }
}
```
